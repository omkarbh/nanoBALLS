Erosion and dilation operators.

This module provides a set of functions and class to perform erosions and
dilations. The module contains basic and complex operators that are based
on neighbor comparisons. In particular, it defines the structuring element
class which serve as the base for these operators. The module also contains
distance functions based on erosion.
