 * Performs a watershed segmentation of the image using the marker image
 * as a starting point for the flooding. The function returns the catchment 
 * basins of the watershed but no actual watershed line. It is recommended
 * to use this function rather than MB_Watershed if you are only interested
 * in catchment basins (faster).
 * The result is put into a the 32-bit marker image.
 *
 * The segmentation is coded as follows into the 32-bit values.
 * | 0      | 1      | 2      | 3      |
 * |--------|--------|--------|--------|
 * | Segment label            | Unused |
